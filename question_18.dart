// Q.18: Create a map named "person" with the following key-value pairs: "name" 
// as "John", "age" as 25, "isStudent" as true. Write a Dart code to check if the 
// person is both a student and over 18 years old. Print "Eligible" if both 
// conditions are true, otherwise print "Not eligible"

void main(){
  Map<String,dynamic> person = {"Name":"John","age": 25, "isStudent": true};
  
  //  person.map((key, value) => person["age"]> 25);
   print(person);
